# Fibonacci Sequence Timing

This repository contains a C++ program that compares the time it takes to calculate a set number of Fibonacci sequence values using different methods.

## Methods

The program implements the following methods to calculate Fibonacci numbers:

1. **Recursive Method**: A simple recursive approach.
2. **Iterative Method**: An iterative approach using loops.
3. **Dynamic Programming Method**: An optimized approach using memoization.

## Usage

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
./fibonacci
```

## Output

The program will output the time taken by each method to calculate the Fibonacci numbers.
